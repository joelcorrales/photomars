# Photomars

TEST ANGULAR

SC Test:

Using Create Angular App or your custom solution (Angular is a must), build an app that:

- Connects to the NASA API ( NASA Open APIs )
- Obtains photos from the 'Mars Rover' endpoint
- Allows the user to see the photos of each rover (Curiosity, Opportunity and Spirit)
- The photos list should be paginated showing a max of 25 photos per page (dynamic loading similar to facebook/instagram will be nice, but not required)
- Allows the user to filter the rover photos by camera
- By default it shows the latest photos for current day
- Allows the user to search for photos based on 'Earth Day' date (2020-09-22)
- Allows the user to search for photos based on the 'Sol' date (2890)

Optional:

- Let the user store search parameters as favorites or bookmarks that can be recalled in the future (Local storage is accepted, any serverless way of storing data is also accepted)
- A lot of extra points if you include a few tests.
- We don't care about the UX design, but a nicely styled app would get extra points :D

  We will check for coding style and consistency mostly, we are interested on seeing how you think and organize a project.
  Please use a linter!

When you finish the test, push it as a public repository in github, gitlab, bitbucket or similar and send us the repository URL.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
